#### Changing the Look of Action Buttons ####

You can change the looks of the action buttons in Dominos using an addon called [Button Facade](http://www.wowace.com/projects/buttonfacade/pages/main/).  A wide variety of [styles](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/search.php?search=button+facade&title&author&page=1&so=asc&sb=title) are available for the addon.

[rActionButtonStyler](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info12024-rActionButtonStyler.html) is a nice alternative to Button Facade.


#### Out of Range Coloring ####

Ever want the entire button to become red when the skill associated it is out of range?  Look no further than [RedRange](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info4166-RedRange.html).  [RangeColors](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info13334-RangeColors.html#info) has been suggested as a nice alternative.

Recently, I wrote [tullaRange](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info15636-tullaRange.html), which is intended to perform the same functions as the above addons, but with a focus on minimizing CPU usage.


#### Cooldown Count ####

My own addon, [OmniCC](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info4836-OmniCC.html), will display text on your action buttons display exactly when the ability will be ready to use.  [Cooldown Count](http://www.wowace.com/projects/cooldown-count/) is a well known alternative.


#### Buff and Debuff Highlighting ####

[Inline Aura](http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/inline-aura.aspx)   What this addon does is add a green border around buttons that contain buffs that you currently have on yourself, or a friendly target.  It also displays a purple border around debuffs you've cast on an enemy target.  In addition, it can display aura durations, like cooldown count type addons do for timers.

[Proc Borders](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=12566) allows you to highlight an action whenever you have a certain buff up.  Its great if you want, for example, to have Shadow Bolt to be highlighted when Shadow Trance is up.

#### Bindings ####

[SnowFall KeyPress](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info15078-SnowfallKeyPress.html) and [Speedy Actions](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info15212-SpeedyActions.html) allow you to execute actions when you press a key, instead of on release.
