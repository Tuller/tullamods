#summary How to file bug reports/feature requests/etc

For submitting bug reports and feature requests, I prefer you all to use [http://code.google.com/p/tullamods/issues/list Google code issue tracker].  If you absolutely refuse to use Google Code, I do read the issues on both WoWInterface and !CurseForge.

=== How To Submit a Bug Report ===

The following information is absolutely necessary when submitting a bug report:
 * Addon name
 * Addon version
 * What other addons you were running at the time.

Its also really helpful for you to do the following, too:
 * If you're not running the latest version of the addon for your game version, then grab the new version and try to reproduce the error.
 * Try to reproduce the error with all other addons disabled.  This is necessary to determine if the issue is due to a conflict with another addon or not.
 * Provide a step by step walkthrough on how to reproduce the error.

The best way to have your feature request implemented is to write it yourself :)
