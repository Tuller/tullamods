Due to the significant time I invest in developing addons, and because I've been asked before, I have a paypal account setup for donations.  All money will be spent on the following:
  * _World of Warcraft_ subscription fees
  * Ventrilo server hosting
  * Computer parts
  * Video games
  * Shiny things
  * Food
  * A trustworthy pony
  * Other

That list does not include "implementing features you pay me to."  Do not feel obligated at all to donate to me.  I enjoy what I do and have no plans to stop if I do not receive even a dime from this.

If you don't want to donate money directly to me, please consider subscribing to your favorite addons site where I host my projects.  All of us addon authors depend on them greatly.
