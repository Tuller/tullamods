#summary Stuff I want to do
#labels Featured

[Bagnon]:
  * Add in guild bank support
  * Do something with saved searches/bookmarks

[Bagnon_Forever]:
  * Add command line searching using LibItemSearch
  * Merge changes from BagSync

Combuctor:
  * Rewrite, like I did for Bagnon.
  * Implement OO based set API, add in wrapper for LibItemSearch
  * Add in event-> tab event system (ex, show bank frame, normal tab when showing the bank, keyring when I click the keyring, trade bags...)
  * Add in a few configuration options (scale, etc)

[Dominos]:
  * Clean up wiki, add in a FAQ
  * Write a totem bar that more closely resembles the stock one.
  * Clean up the interface for show states
  * Revise wiki, add FAQ

[Ludwig]:
  * Clean up GUI code

[OmniCC]:
  * Rewrite, merge in Shine and Pulse.
  * Do pros/cons analysis of opt in vs current opt out model.

Move over to GitHub:
  * I still basically have this crazy idea in my head that if I make it possible for people to easily pull my code, then they'll make changes to it for me :P  Odds are, it won't happen though :P

-----
Experiments/Random Ideas I Have:
  * Dominos + Perspectives: I want a system where I get to have multiple layouts based on what macro state I'm in.  Basically I only want to show a vehicle bar when in a vehicle, a possess bar when possessing something, and have key bindings setup for each form.
  * OptInCC: Cooldown count implemented like ButtonFacade.  This won't work on everything, but will allow users to have finer tuned control.
