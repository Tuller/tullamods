Experiments/Random Ideas I Have:
* Dominos + Perspectives: I want a system where I get to have multiple layouts based on what macro state I'm in.  Basically I only want to show a vehicle bar when in a vehicle, a possess bar when possessing something, and have key bindings setup for each form.
* An infinite macro button addon:  I want to write an addon where I can draw as many macro bars as I want using the system I developed for Bongos3.  The scope of this addon should be heavily limited (ie, I expect you to use this addon with the stock interface, or with another actionbar addon).  Should also use the perspective system I intend on developing, for best effect.
